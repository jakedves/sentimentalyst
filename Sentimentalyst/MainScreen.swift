I had an amazing day today.

I watched some WWDC talks, learnt about Swift and practised writing some code. Swift Charts is so good, and the charts are so customizable! I had to fix so many bugs in my code however, and this made me so angry. I hate having to find typos and fixing data types.

Using the natural language framework Apple provides really demonstrates how trivial it is now to bring great power into modern apps. I was able to not only train a machine learning model with a few lines of code, but I could use it by simply dragging it in.
 How cool is that? I was a bit sad because it means some of the great complexity of NLP is hidden from the user, and I think that‚Äôs disappointing. I have to remember it‚Äôs a good thing overall, and makes everyone‚Äôs apps that much better.

After that I had my favourite dinner ever - sausage and mash. It was perfect. Delicious. Made to perfection. Now I plan to do some reading and catch up on sleep. Goodnight!
